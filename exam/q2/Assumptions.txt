In order to implement a version of tic-tac-toe that would be playable
I made the assumption that "no user interface" meant nothing big/creative and
graphical was meant, if the case was that absolutely no interface was
intended then simply commenting out my print function would allow the 
game to continue being played while tracking all game data and giving
the players back no information.

I also made the assumption that the meaning of "it should be written such
that a tic-tac-toe interface could use it" meant that the gameBoard would 
need a way to get what pieces are on specific spots on the board and that
a gameBoard object would be able to set pieces as well if needed (unused
as that functionality lies in the run function so the game is playable).
